# Hosanna Gabe-Oji

Senior Backend Engineer focused on building reliable, production-grade APIs and cloud-native systems using **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

## Core focus
- Backend systems: **Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs**
- Event-driven & asynchronous processing (retries, idempotency, DLQs)
- Cloud deployments on **AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)** and containerization with **Docker**
- Designing systems for reliability, observability, and long-term maintainability

## Versatility & background
Alongside my backend specialization, I have hands-on experience working across the stack:
- Full-stack applications (backend APIs with frontend integrations)
- Mobile development (Android)
- Cloud integrations and CI/CD workflows

This breadth complements my backend specialization rather than replacing it.

## Leadership & collaboration
- Led and supported cross-functional engineering teams across backend, frontend, and mobile roles
- Contributed to delivery planning, engineering standards, and mentoring
- Conducted technical screening and structured evaluations across backend and full-stack stacks

## Current work
🚧 **NotifyHub** — a production-style notification platform demonstrating real-world backend patterns such as event-driven processing, reliability strategies, and AWS-based deployment.

I use this space to build, document, and refine backend systems inspired by real production challenges.
